    "give me all about filter function \n",
    "The filter function is a built-in function in Python that is used to filter elements from a sequence (list, tuple, etc.) based on a given condition. It takes two arguments: a function and a sequence. The function is used to evaluate each element in the sequence, and only the elements for which the function returns True are included in the resulting sequence.\n",

    "filter(function, sequence)\n",
    "Where function is a function that takes a single argument and returns a Boolean value (True or False), and sequence is the input sequence that you want to filter.

    "\n",
    "Note that the filter function works with any sequence type in Python, not just lists. Additionally, you can use any function as the input function, not just a lambda function. The function just needs to take a single argument and return a Boolean value.\n",
