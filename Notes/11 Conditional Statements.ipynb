    "give me all about conditional statements in python\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. These statements are used to execute specific blocks of code only if a certain condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of conditional statements in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "If statement:\n",
    "The if statement is the simplest and most commonly used conditional statement in Python. It checks if a condition is true, and if it is, it executes a block of code. The basic syntax of an if statement is:\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "# code to execute if condition is true\n",
    "\n",
    "If-else statement:\n",
    "The if-else statement extends the if statement by providing an alternative code block to execute if the condition is false. The basic syntax of an if-else statement is:\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "# code to execute if condition is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "# code to execute if condition is false\n",
    "\n",
    "If-elif-else statement:\n",
    "The if-elif-else statement allows multiple conditions to be tested and multiple code blocks to be executed. The basic syntax of an if-elif-else statement is:\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "# code to execute if condition1 is true\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "# code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "# code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are false\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these basic conditional statements, Python also supports nested if statements, where an if statement is included inside another if statement. This allows for more complex conditions to be tested and acted upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that conditions in Python must be written in a way that returns a Boolean value (either True or False). This can be achieved by using comparison operators (such as <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=), logical operators (such as and, or, not), and other Boolean expressions.\n",

    "any advanced topics in conditional topics other than above\n",
    "Yes, there are some advanced topics in conditional statements in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ternary operator:\n",
    "The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write a simple if-else statement. It takes the form of:\n",
    "value_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "result = value_if_true\n",

    "\n",
    "You can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "result = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-circuit evaluation:\n",
    "Short-circuit evaluation is a technique used in conditional statements to avoid unnecessary evaluations. In Python, the and and or operators perform short-circuit evaluations. This means that if the first operand of an and expression is False, the second operand is not evaluated, as it cannot affect the overall truth value of the expression. Similarly, if the first operand of an or expression is True, the second operand is not evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chained comparison operators:\n",
    "Chained comparison operators allow multiple conditions to be tested in a concise way. For example, instead of writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "if a < b and b < c:\n",
    "# code to execute\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write:\n",

If this condition is also true, it prints \"x is between 0 and 10\". If x is greater than or equal to 10, it prints \"x is greater than or equal to 10\". If the first condition is false (i.e., x is less than or equal to 0), it prints \"x is less than or equal to 0\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are a fundamental concept in programming. They allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. In this blog, we'll cover the basics of conditional statements in Python and some of the advanced topics that you can explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python are represented by the if, elif, and else keywords. The if statement is used to check if a condition is true, and if it is, the code block following the if statement will be executed. For example:\n",

    "Finally, the else keyword is used to specify a default action. If all conditions are false, the code block following the else statement will be executed. For example:\n",

    "if x > 10:\n",

    "Nested conditional statements are conditional statements within another conditional statement. In other words, it’s a way to embed multiple conditions within each other. This can be useful when you want to check multiple conditions within a single if statement.\n",

    "Here's an example of a simple nested conditional statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "if y > 0:\n",
    "print(\"Both x and y are positive\")\n",

If the first condition is false, it prints \"x is non-positive\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of a nested conditional statement is when you want to check the grade of a student based on their score:\n",

    "score = 75\n",

    "grade = \"C\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "grade = \"D\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a score of 75. The first condition checks if the score is greater than or equal to 90, and if it's not, it checks if the score is greater than or equal to 80. If the score is between 80 and 89, it assigns the grade \"B\". However, if the score is 85 or higher, it changes the grade to \"B+\". The rest of the conditions assign grades based on the score.\n",
